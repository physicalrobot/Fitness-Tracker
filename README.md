# Fitness Tracker

## Learning Goals

- Build a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

This is app tracks the workouts the workouts I plan to do at the gym. You can create, edit, delete and schedule workouts to specific days on the calendar.

The focus of this project is **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.
